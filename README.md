This project is a simple map/text-based game coded in C++. In this game, the player must visit 6 rooms in a simple 1 floor layout and complete all challenges to collect the letters of the password to exit the game. Once all challenges have been completed, the player may win the game by exiting the room, but they must rearrange the letters of the password in order to win. In this game, each movement between rooms takes one minute. The player has 30 minutes to complete the game before they lose by running out of time.

In order to play this game, clone the repository and use the included makefile to complie the game, then run in the console.
