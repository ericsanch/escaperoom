Welcome to the Escape Room

You are trapped in a room armed only with your wits and your luck to escape!
Move through each room presented to you on the map. When you enter each room
you will have to solve a mini-game or puzzle to get a letter. Once you've
collected each letter, it will be up to you to unscramble the password to
escape the locked door.

You only have 30 minutes to escape! It takes 1 minute to move one space or
play a mini-game, so make sure you are being efficient, and answer carefully
 - the more times you lose a game or answer a puzzle wrong, the more of your
time you will burn through.

Move around using the direction keys you would use if you were navigating
in vim (h = left, j = down, k = up, l = right) followed by ENTER. Your location
is marked with an 'X'. A room marked with a '+' represents a room which you have
not completed the designated task. Each game or puzzle will tell you how to respond.
